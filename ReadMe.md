# ExpertTool

## Description

ExpertTool is a utility for managing enabling/disabling Delphi experts. 

It is similar to the Expert Manager in GExperts, however it has some extra features over and above Expert Manager.

## Compiling ExpertTool

ExpertTool was written in Embarcadero's Delphi, using version 11.0, however it may compile for earlier/later versions.
